# Ncurses-tetris
A tetris clone written in C, using ncurses.

As of right now, I've got a working basis.

Code is a bit unwieldy.

So, what's left to-do:

1. Finish game states (pause / 'dead' / start-screen / ..)
2. Clean up the code / use more consistent naming etc

~Split code up into different files.~ <- somewhat done
