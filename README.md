# Ncurses-tetris
A tetris clone written in C, using ncurses.

Code is a bit unwieldy.

The part of this program that handles file IO is absolute unstable trash.
I'll probably clean that up

It's got:
  - you can see the next block that's going to spawn
  - block 'shadows'

So, what's left to-do:

- Clean code up a ~bit.~ lot
- Add difficulty levels maybe
- Add "save files"
