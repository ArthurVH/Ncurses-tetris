# Ncurses-tetris
A tetris clone written in C, using ncurses.

As of right now, I've got a working basis.

Code is a bit unwieldy.

So, what's left to-do:

1. Split code up into different files.
2. Add game states (pause / 'dead' / start-screen / ..)
3. Clean up the code / use more consistent naming etc
