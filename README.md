# Ncurses-tetris
A tetris clone written in C, using ncurses.

Code is a bit messy/too large, but should still be nicely readable. Will rewrite the whole program when i have time.
Also: there's a mixture of tabs and spaces, because i recently switched to using tabs for indentation. Apologies to anyone who has to witness such heresy.

Might have to re-do the part of the program that handles file IO, but it works for now.

Program works fine; it's tetris i guess.
It's got block shadows, a little preview of the next block that's going to spawn etc. Pretty nice imo.
Scores get saved in "~/.tetris/scores.tetris".
